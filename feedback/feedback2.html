  <h1>DragonX Project Reflection and Revision</h1>
  <p>The feedback that I received was that the site was a little too dark, the color scheme seemed a little dated, and the content needed some breathing room. The theme of the site has been lightened in the revision while maintaining much of the original structure. I also increased the padding, margins, and included a java script slideshow on the homepage.</p>
  <p>I've worked in a variety of IT roles for several years, developed more scripts than I can count (batch, vbscript, powershell, java, etc.), and used HTML in HTAs to streamline day to day sysadmin support tasks. The emphasis was always functionality over aesthetics since I really only developed the tools for our admin teams use. Though I've managed several web-based systems, including the servers which host the sites, I wasn't sure where to start with the development of my own website. This class gave me EXACTLY what I needed at a pace that gave me time to process and understand how it works. Building on prior classwork was the perfect approach.</p>
  <p>I'm of the opinion that if more Computer Science classes were taught like this class, we would have a far more diverse IT workforce as curious students interested in a career in Information Technology wouldn't be intimidated or overwhelmed by the class. </p>
  <p>My grade was good enough that I wasn't going to bother completing the reflection assignment but I felt like you deserved some feedback given that you did such an outstanding job. Thank you!</p>
